#+TITLE: A Haskell Implementation of PPAP, by Pikotaro

This Haskell package implements the logic underlying Pikatoro's PPAP (Pen Pineapple Apple Pen) 2016 video, illustrating the following Haskell concepts:
- algebraic datatypes
- composition via Semigroup
- automatic derivation into Eq, Ord, and Show typeclasses
- filtering a list using list comprehensions
- pattern matches
- pattern guards
- user-defined infix operator functions
- use of Prettyprinter
- the IO monad

We consider the original performance to be an illustration of an
equivalence relation between binary trees constructed using repeated
monoidal append of elements from a many-sorted domain.

The key binary operation visibly demonstrated in the song is the pair
-- which we model in Haskell using monoidal append, written ~mappend~
or ~(<>)~, pronounced, according to the song, "unh". The song provides
copious illustrations of that operation, in two main acts.

Each act first pairs single elements into doubles. Then it further
pairs the doubles into a quad. It will no doubt have occurred to the
attentive reader that a binary tree is an appropriate data structure
to represent the song's semantics, at least initially.

The two acts are structurally identical, but choose different
combinations of starting elements. Both acts repeatedly compose the
same input elements to a top-level root; after two rounds of
composition, the tree root contains $n^2=4$ leaves. However, each act
chooses different permutations of the leaf elements, providing
different preimages to the equivalence relation.

Determining equivalence between the root nodes is facilitated by a
serialization function which maps multiple permutations of input
elements to the same equivalence class by re-ordering the input
elements.

This transformation incidentally shows that the pairing relation is
really a special (binary) case of the more general ~mconcat~ function,
of unlimited arity.

Given that the original element ordering is eventually discarded when
serializing the root, we simplify the representation from a binary
tree to a simple list, wrapped by a Haskell ~newtype~ so that we can
instantiate into the ~Semigroup~ typeclass for reordering, and into
the ~Pretty~ typeclass for prettyprinting.
